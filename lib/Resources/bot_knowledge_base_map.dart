- Understanding Databases and Tables
Now that you've installed MySQL and created a sample database, it's time to learn the fundamental building blocks: Databases and Tables.

Q) What is a Database in MySQL?
ANS) A database is a container for organizing and storing data. Within a database, data is stored in tables.

Q) What is a Table?
ANS) A table is a structured collection of rows and columns. It organizes data in a format like a spreadsheet.

- Columns: Define the data type (e.g., integer, text, date).
- Rows: Represent individual records.

=> Basic Commands for Managing Databases and Tables
1. Creating a Database
Use the CREATE DATABASE command to create a new database.

- sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE StudentDB;

2. Selecting a Database
Switch to a database using the USE command.

- sql
Copy code
USE StudentDB;

3. Creating a Table
Define the table structure with column names and data types.

- sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Students (
    ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Age INT,
    Gender ENUM('Male', 'Female'),
    AdmissionDate DATE
);

- ID: A unique identifier for each student (auto-incremented).
- Name: A variable-length string up to 255 characters.
- Age: An integer.
- Gender: Restricted to specific values.
- AdmissionDate: Stores dates.

4. Viewing Tables in a Database
List all tables in the current database.

- sql
Copy code
SHOW TABLES;

5. Viewing Table Structure
See the structure of a table (columns, data types, etc.).

- sql
Copy code
DESCRIBE Students;

=> Key Data Types in MySQL

- Numeric:
INT: Integer numbers.
FLOAT, DOUBLE: Decimal numbers.

- String:
VARCHAR(size): Variable-length string (e.g., VARCHAR(255)).
TEXT: Large text data.

- Date and Time:
DATE: Stores dates (YYYY-MM-DD).
DATETIME: Stores date and time.

- Enumerated:
ENUM: A predefined list of values.
Tasks for Today

- Create a New Database:
Name it LibraryDB.

- Switch to the Database:
Use USE LibraryDB.

- Create a Table for Books: Define columns:
BookID (auto-incremented primary key).
Title (string up to 255 characters).
Author (string up to 255 characters).
PublishedDate (date).
Genre (e.g., Fiction, Non-Fiction, etc.).

- List Tables in LibraryDB:
Verify that the table is created using SHOW TABLES.

- Describe the Books Table:
View its structure using DESCRIBE Books.
Bonus: Explore Data Types

Create a second table with a mix of data types (e.g., numeric, string, date).

          """Topic 3: Inserting and Retrieving Data in MySQL
Now that you've created tables in your database, it's time to learn how to add data to your tables and retrieve it efficiently.

1. Inserting Data into Tables
Use the INSERT INTO command to add rows to a table.

Syntax
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) 
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
Example
Insert a new record into the Books table:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Books (Title, Author, PublishedDate, Genre)
VALUES ('To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee', '1960-07-11', 'Fiction');
Inserting Multiple Rows
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Books (Title, Author, PublishedDate, Genre)
VALUES 
    ('1984', 'George Orwell', '1949-06-08', 'Fiction'),
    ('The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', '1925-04-10', 'Fiction');
2. Retrieving Data from Tables
Use the SELECT statement to fetch data.

Basic Query
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Books;
Fetches all rows and columns.
Selecting Specific Columns
sql
Copy code
SELECT Title, Author FROM Books;
Filtering Results with WHERE
Retrieve specific rows using conditions:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Genre = 'Fiction';
Sorting Results with ORDER BY
Sort data in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Books ORDER BY PublishedDate DESC;
Limiting Results
Restrict the number of rows:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Books LIMIT 2;
3. Updating Data in Tables
Use the UPDATE command to modify existing records.

Syntax
sql
Copy code
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
Example
Update the genre of a specific book:

sql
Copy code
UPDATE Books
SET Genre = 'Classic Fiction'
WHERE Title = '1984';
4. Deleting Data from Tables
Use the DELETE command to remove records.

Syntax
sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Example
Delete a book by title:

sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM Books WHERE Title = 'The Great Gatsby';
Tasks for Today
Insert Records into the Books Table:

Add at least 5 different books with details (Title, Author, PublishedDate, Genre).
Retrieve Data:

Fetch all records using SELECT *.
Retrieve only the Title and Author columns.
Get all books in the "Fiction" genre.
Sort and Limit Results:

Retrieve all books sorted by PublishedDate in descending order.
Fetch the most recently published book.
Update Data:

Change the genre of one book to "Historical Fiction."

What is MySQL?
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It stores data in tables and allows efficient querying and management of data using SQL (Structured Query Language). MySQL is widely used for web applications, data storage, and processing.

=> Key Features of MySQL

Relational: Organizes data into tables with rows and columns.

Open Source: Free to use, with optional paid enterprise features.

Scalable: Handles small to large-scale applications.

Cross-platform: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

High Performance: Efficient for reading/writing data.

Secure: User access control, encryption, and security mechanisms.

Support for JSON: Ideal for semi-structured data.

=> Use Cases
- Web applications (e.g., WordPress, Drupal).
- E-commerce platforms.
- Data analytics.
- Backend for mobile apps (like in your Flutter projects!).

=> Installing MySQL
Option 1: Install MySQL Locally

Windows:
- Download MySQL Installer from official website.
- Run the installer and select 'Developer Default.'
- Follow the setup process and set up the root password.
- Test installation via mysql -u root -p in the terminal.

Linux (Ubuntu):
- bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation

- Follow the prompts to secure the installation.

macOS:
Use Homebrew:
- bash
Copy code
brew install mysql
brew services start mysql

=> mysql_secure_installation

Option 2: Use MySQL Remotely
Platforms like AWS RDS, Azure, or Google Cloud provide managed MySQL instances.
We'll cover this later if needed.

=> Interacting with MySQL
- Command Line (MySQL CLI)
- Open MySQL using:
- bash
Copy code
mysql -u root -p

- You’ll interact directly by writing SQL commands.

=> MySQL Workbench
- A GUI tool for managing MySQL visually.
- Download it from here.
- Tasks for Today

=> Install MySQL Locally:

- Choose the appropriate installer for your system and install MySQL.
- Create a root password during installation.

=> Test MySQL:

- Open a terminal or MySQL Workbench.
- Log in with your root account: mysql -u root -p.
- Create a Database: Run the following commands after logging into MySQL:

- sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE TestDB;
SHOW DATABASES;
Learn Basic Queries: Experiment with:

=> Creating a new database.
- Viewing all databases.
- Deleting a database:
